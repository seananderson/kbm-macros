# Keyboard Maestro macros for MacOS voice control

I use this with [Aenea](https://github.com/dictation-toolbox/aenea) and custom grammars to code and operate a Mac by voice.

My fork of Aenea: <https://github.com/seananderson/aenea>

My custom grammars: <https://github.com/seananderson/aenea-grammars>

My fork of Aenea allows these macros to be executed by adding "KBM " at the beginning of a Text() call (and includes a number of other fixes to work with the current version of MacOS).

Included are macros for opening applications and manipulating window positions.
